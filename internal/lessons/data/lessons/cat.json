        "what": "The `cat` command displays the contents of files in your terminal. The name stands for **'concatenate'** because it can combine multiple files, but its most common use is simply viewing what's inside a single file.\n\nThink of `cat` as opening a file and reading it out loud. It's one of the most frequently used commands for quickly checking file contents without opening an editor.",
        "history": "The `cat` command has been part of Unix since Version 1 in 1971, making it one of the oldest Unix commands still in everyday use.\n\nIt was created by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (the inventors of Unix) as a simple utility to concatenate files - hence the name. In the early days of Unix, combining text files was a common task for processing data.\n\nThe name caused some confusion over the years because most people use it to view a single file, not to concatenate multiple files. But by the time this became the primary use case, the name was already established and couldn't be changed without breaking thousands of scripts.\n\nInterestingly, `cat` became so ubiquitous that \"catting a file\" became common programmer slang for viewing file contents.",
        "example": "```bash\n# View a single file\ncat README.txt\n\n# Concatenate multiple files\ncat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\n\n# Display with line numbers\ncat -n script.sh\n\n# Show non-printing characters\ncat -A config.txt\n\n# Combine files and save to new file\ncat header.txt body.txt footer.txt > complete.txt\n\n# Append to existing file\ncat additional.txt >> existing.txt\n```",

        "what": "When you pass multiple filenames to `cat`, it **concatenates** them - combining them one after another in the order you specify. This is the original purpose that gave `cat` its name.\n\nThe real power comes when you use the `>` redirect operator to save the merged output to a new file:\n```bash\ncat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > combined.txt\n```\n\nThis creates a new file containing all the contents merged together. It's incredibly useful for merging data, combining logs, or assembling documents from parts.",
        "history": "File concatenation was essential in early Unix workflows. Before databases and structured file formats became common, text processing involved combining many small files.\n\nTypical 1970s Unix workflows:\n- Generating reports by combining headers, data, and footers\n- Processing log files split by date or system\n- Building documentation from modular sections\n- Creating configuration files from templates and custom settings\n\nThe `>` redirect operator (introduced in the original Unix shell) made this workflow powerful: combine files with `cat`, redirect to a new file, then process it further. Combined with pipes and redirection, it enabled complex text processing without special tools.",

        "history": "The `-n` flag was added to `cat` in early Unix to support text editing and programming workflows. Before graphical IDEs, programmers worked entirely in terminals.\n\nWhen error messages said \"syntax error on line 127\", you needed a quick way to find that line. You could:\n1. Open the file in `ed` or `vi` and jump to that line\n2. Use `cat -n` to display the file with numbers\n3. Use `sed -n '127p'` to print just that line\n\nThe `-n` flag made code review and debugging much faster.
