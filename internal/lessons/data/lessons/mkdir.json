        "what": "The `mkdir` command **creates new directories** (folders). The name stands for **'make directory'**. It's one of the fundamental commands for organizing your filesystem.\n\nEvery project, every organization system, every file structure starts with creating directories. Without `mkdir`, you'd have no way to organize files into logical groups.",
        "history": "`mkdir` has been part of Unix since the very early days in the 1970s. In the original Unix filesystem, creating directories was actually a complex operation that required special system calls.\n\nEarly Unix systems had strict limitations on directory depth and naming. The original Unix filesystem (Version 1) only supported 14-character filenames, and deeply nested directories could cause performance issues on the small computers of the era.\n\nThe command has remained remarkably consistent over 50+ years. The same `mkdir projects` command that worked in 1975 still works identically today.\n\nInterestingly, the Windows command `md` (make directory) was inspired by Unix's `mkdir`, though DOS adopted the shorter name to save typing on slow terminals.",
        "example": "```bash\n# Create a single directory\nmkdir projects\n\n# Create multiple directories at once\nmkdir docs images videos\n\n# Create nested structure with -p flag\nmkdir -p projects/myapp/src/components\n\n# Common workflow: create and navigate\nmkdir my-project\ncd my-project\n\n# Organize a project structure\nmkdir -p src tests docs assets\n```",

        "history": "The `-p` flag was added to `mkdir` in the late 1970s when developers realized that creating nested directory structures was a common task that required too many commands.\n\nEarly Unix systems forced you to create each directory level individually, which was tedious for deep hierarchies. The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) introduced the `-p` flag to solve this, and it quickly became standard across all Unix variants.\n\nThe flag name 'p' comes from 'parents' - it creates parent directories as needed. It also has the useful property of **not erroring** if the directory already exists, making it idempotent (safe to run multiple times).\n\nToday, `mkdir -p` is one of the most common flag combinations, appearing in countless build scripts, installation scripts, and automation tools.",

        "history": "Multi-argument support in `mkdir` has been present since early Unix. The Unix philosophy emphasized creating tools that could process multiple inputs, and `mkdir` followed this pattern.\n\nThe real power came with **brace expansion**, introduced in the C shell (csh) in the late 1970s and later adopted by Bash and other modern shells. Brace expansion lets you generate multiple arguments from a compact pattern.\n\nBefore brace expansion, scripts would use loops:\n```bash\nfor dir in src tests docs; do\n  mkdir $dir\ndone\n```\n\nWith brace expansion:\n```bash\nmkdir {src,tests,docs}\n```\n\nThis pattern is now fundamental to shell scripting and interactive command-line work.",
