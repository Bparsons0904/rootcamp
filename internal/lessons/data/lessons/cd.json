        "what": "The `cd` command lets you **change directory** - moving from one folder to another in the filesystem. It stands for **'change directory'** and is essential for navigating your file system.\n\nThink of your filesystem as a tree of folders. `pwd` tells you where you are, `ls` shows you what's nearby, and `cd` lets you move around. Together, these three commands are the foundation of terminal navigation.\n\nWithout `cd`, you'd be stuck in one location, unable to access files in other directories.",
        "history": "The `cd` command has existed since the earliest Unix shells in the 1970s. Interestingly, `cd` is not a standalone program like `ls` or `cat` - it's a **shell built-in** command.\n\nThis is because changing directories requires modifying the shell's own state (its current working directory). If `cd` were an external program, it would change that program's directory, not the shell's, and you'd end up right back where you started when the program exited.\n\nThis design decision was made by Ken Thompson when creating the original Unix shell, and it's been part of every shell since - bash, zsh, fish, and others all implement `cd` as a built-in.\n\nThe command is so fundamental that most Unix tutorials start with three commands: `pwd` (where am I?), `ls` (what's here?), and `cd` (go somewhere else).",
        "example": "```bash\n# Change to a specific directory\ncd documents\ncd /home/user/projects\n\n# Go to parent directory\ncd ..\n\n# Go to home directory\ncd ~\ncd  # cd with no arguments also goes home\n\n# Go to previous directory\ncd -\n\n# Use relative paths\ncd ../other-folder\ncd ../../parent/sibling\n\n# Use absolute paths\ncd /var/log\ncd /usr/local/bin\n```",

You can chain them together: `cd ../..` moves up two levels.",
        "history": "The `.` and `..` convention was introduced in early Unix as a clever way to reference directories relatively. They aren't real files - they're special directory entries maintained by the filesystem.\n\nIn the original Unix filesystem (early 1970s), directories were simple files containing name-to-inode mappings. The filesystem automatically added `.` and `..` entries to every directory:\n- `.` pointed to the directory's own inode  \n- `..` pointed to the parent directory's inode\n\nThis simple design enabled relative navigation without complex path parsing. Want to go up? Just `cd ..`. Want to reference the current directory explicitly? Use `.`\n\nThe pattern was so elegant that every filesystem since has maintained this convention, including modern filesystems like ext4, NTFS, and APFS.\n\nFun fact: The root directory (`/`) is special - its `..` entry points to itself, since it has no parent.",

When you run `cd -`, the shell swaps your current directory (`$PWD`) with your previous directory (`$OLDPWD`).\n\nThis is incredibly useful when you're bouncing between two locations:\n```bash\ncd /var/log      # Go to logs\ncd ~/projects    # Go to projects\ncd -             # Back to /var/log\ncd -             # Back to ~/projects\n```",
        "history": "The `cd -` feature was introduced in the Korn shell (ksh) in the early 1980s and became popular enough that bash and other shells adopted it.\n\nBefore `cd -`, users had to manually type paths or use complex shell aliases to return to previous directories. David Korn's innovation was to make the shell automatically track the previous directory in `$OLDPWD`.\n\nThe `-` symbol was chosen because it was already used in other Unix commands to mean \"previous\" or \"standard input/output\" (like `tar -` or `diff - file.txt`).\n\nInterestingly, `cd -` also prints the directory it's switching to, which helps you confirm where you ended up. This small usability feature has saved countless users from confusion.\n\nToday, `cd -` is so common that it's one of the first shortcuts experienced terminal users teach to beginners.",

        "history": "The distinction between absolute and relative paths has existed since the earliest filesystems in the 1960s-70s.\n\nEarly Unix (1969-1971) established the `/` (slash) as the root of the filesystem tree. Any path starting with `/` was absolute - describing the complete route from root to destination. Paths without a leading `/` were interpreted relative to the current directory.\n\nThis design was influenced by Multics (Unix's predecessor), which pioneered hierarchical filesystems. The Unix creators simplified Multics' approach, making the distinction between absolute and relative paths intuitive:\n- Starts with `/`? Absolute.\n- Doesn't start with `/`? Relative.\n\nThe `.` and `..` special directories (introduced in early Unix) made relative paths more powerful, enabling navigation like `../../../other/location`.\n\nThis simple, elegant system has remained unchanged for over 50 years and is used by virtually every modern operating system.",
