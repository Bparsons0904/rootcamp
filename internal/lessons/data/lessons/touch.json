        "what": "The `touch` command **creates empty files** or **updates the timestamp** of existing files. While it seems simple, it's incredibly useful for:\n\n- Quickly creating placeholder files\n- Resetting file modification times\n- Creating files that other programs expect to exist\n- Testing scripts that check for file presence\n\nThe name 'touch' comes from the idea of 'touching' a file to update its modification time, but its most common use today is creating new empty files.",
        "history": "`touch` was added to Unix in the early 1970s, but its original purpose was quite different from how it's used today!\n\nInitially, `touch` was created to **update file timestamps** for build systems. The `make` command (used for compiling programs) decides what to rebuild based on file modification times. Developers needed a way to manually update timestamps to force or prevent rebuilds, so `touch` was born.\n\nThe side effect of creating files if they didn't exist was almost accidental - the command would create a file with the current timestamp if it wasn't found. Over time, this side effect became the primary use case!\n\nToday, most people use `touch` to create empty files and rarely think about its timestamp-updating capabilities. It's a perfect example of a tool evolving beyond its original purpose.",
        "example": "```bash\n# Create a single empty file\ntouch newfile.txt\n\n# Create multiple files at once\ntouch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\n\n# Common pattern: create before editing\ntouch config.json\nvim config.json\n\n# Create files with specific extensions\ntouch index.html style.css script.js\n\n# Update modification time of existing file\ntouch existing-file.txt  # Updates timestamp to now\n\n# Verify file was created\ntouch myfile.txt\nls -l myfile.txt  # Shows size of 0 bytes\n```",

        "what": "`touch` can create **multiple files simultaneously** by listing them as arguments:\n\n```bash\ntouch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\n```\n\nThis is incredibly useful for setting up project structures. Instead of running `touch` three times, you create all files at once.\n\nYou can also use **brace expansion** (a shell feature) for related files:\n```bash\ntouch {index,about,contact}.html\n# Creates: index.html, about.html, contact.html\n```\n\nThis makes project initialization much faster and more efficient.",
        "history": "Multi-file support in `touch` has been present since early Unix, following the Unix philosophy of tools that work on multiple inputs.\n\nThe real productivity boost came with **brace expansion** in modern shells (Bash, Zsh). This feature lets you generate multiple filenames from patterns:\n\n```bash\n# Create a year's worth of log files\ntouch log-2024-{01..12}.txt\n# Creates: log-2024-01.txt through log-2024-12.txt\n```\n\nThis pattern became especially important with the rise of web development in the 1990s and 2000s, when developers needed to quickly scaffold projects with many files.\n\nToday, creating multiple files with `touch` is a fundamental skill for anyone working on the command line.",

Its name literally means 'touch the file to update its timestamp.'\n\nInterestingly, the ability to create files if they didn't exist was initially just a side effect.
