        "what": "Copy and paste in the terminal works differently than in regular applications. Understanding how to copy and paste is **essential** because you'll frequently need to:\n\n- Copy commands from tutorials or documentation\n- Paste error messages for searching\n- Copy file paths and command outputs\n- Share terminal commands with others\n\n**The key difference:** Most terminals use different keyboard shortcuts than regular applications to avoid conflicts with terminal control sequences.",
        "history": "In the early days of computing, terminals used control characters (like Ctrl+C) for special purposes. Ctrl+C, for example, sends an interrupt signal to stop a running program - it doesn't copy text!\n\nWhen graphical terminals were developed, they needed different shortcuts for copy/paste to avoid breaking these control sequences. Most Linux and Windows terminals settled on adding the Shift key (Ctrl+Shift+C/V), while macOS kept its standard Cmd+C/V shortcuts since they don't conflict.\n\nThis historical baggage is why terminal copy/paste feels different - it's preserving decades of Unix terminal conventions.",
        "example": "```bash\n# Example workflow:\n# 1. Run a command\npwd\n# Output: /home/user/projects\n\n# 2. Select the output path with your mouse\n# 3. Copy it using your OS keyboard shortcut\n# 4. Use it in another command by pasting\ncd [paste here]\n\n# Common use case: copying error messages\nnpm install some-package\n# Error appears - select and copy it\n# Paste into Google/Stack Overflow to find solutions\n```",
