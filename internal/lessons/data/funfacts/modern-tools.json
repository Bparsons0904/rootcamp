      "full": "## ripgrep: grep's Rust-Powered Successor\n\nCreated by **Andrew Gallant** in 2016, `ripgrep` (command: `rg`) is a line-oriented search tool that combines the speed of **ag (The Silver Searcher)** with the usability of grep.\n\n### Why It's Fast\n\n- Written in **Rust** for memory safety and performance\n- Uses **parallel search** across multiple cores\n- Automatically respects `.gitignore` files\n- Smart defaults: skips hidden files, binary files\n\n### Speed Comparison\n\nSearching a large codebase:\n```bash\ngrep -r \"function\" .     # 2.5 seconds\nrg \"function\"            # 0.08 seconds\n```\n\n### Cool Features\n\n- **Regex by default**: No `-E` flag needed\n- **Type filtering**: `rg --type rust \"fn main\"`\n- **Multiline search**: Built-in support\n\n> **Fun fact**: The author created ripgrep because he was frustrated with existing tools while working on large codebases."

      "full": "## fzf: The Fuzzy Finder Revolution\n\nCreated by **Junegunn Choi** in 2013, `fzf` is a **general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder** that's become essential for modern shell users.\n\n### What It Does\n\nInstead of typing exact names, fuzzy matching finds what you mean:\n```bash\ncdproject  → matches \"cd ~/Development/my-project\"\nvimrc     → finds \"~/.vimrc\"\n```\n\n### Integration Power\n\n- **Ctrl-R**: Fuzzy search command history\n- **Ctrl-T**: Fuzzy find files in current directory\n- **Alt-C**: Fuzzy cd into subdirectories\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n```bash\n# Find and edit file\nvim $(fzf)\n\n# Kill process by name\nkill -9 $(ps aux | fzf | awk '{print $2}')\n\n# Git branch switcher\ngit checkout $(git branch | fzf)\n```\n\n### Why It's Revolutionary\n\nBefore fzf, finding files meant:\n1. `ls` to remember exact name\n2. Tab completion with exact prefix\n3. Or full find/grep commands\n\nNow: **type any part of the name** and fuzzy match handles it.\n\n> **Impact**: So influential that fuzzy finding is now built into VSCode, Sublime Text, and most modern editors."
